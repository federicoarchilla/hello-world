# hello-world

Hello World! I am an English teacher form Argentina who is trying to learn some basic programming and to develop my knowledge. I have recently passed some tests on the freeodecamp list of tasks and discovered that I really like the world of programming. I have also read lots of information on this topic and I hope to read and learn a lot more!
